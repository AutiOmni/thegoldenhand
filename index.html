                        There is a troll and a mind flayer in this dining hall. Our mind flayer friend has serious beef with his own kind and this specific mind flayer. 

                        Things happen fast and it is hard for me to recount. At the end the troll joins our side thanks to Dou Rou. The elusive mind flayer escapes us. Brisk is dead. We mourn this brave warrior and friend. Sly has joined the party once again. 

                        All the while I can't help but get the feeling we are being watched from a power higher than we can comprehend.

                        Arnie used Magic Missile to hit three soldiers. Cage runs into the woods. He is talking with a mysterious figure. Glass joins him in the wood. Fargrim heals our dragon as it takes damage but in return his eyes glaze over. He is under the control of someone else. A disgusting looking mind flayer emerges with Glass and Cage from the forest. Did it do this?</p>

                    The soldiers gain control of their senses and drop their weapons. We destroy their giant crossbow. Head towards the city with our disgusting, vile mind flayer friend? Foe? His name is Dou Rou.

The Caster retreats into a crack in the wall. Coward! We follow in pursuit and fight Curly the dog. We come to to discover the bandits are working for The Golden Hand! Seery the bandit is injured.

We head towards the sound came and find Rip Von Brisk dead in a pool of blood. FARGRIM BRINGS HIM BACK TO LIFE! Brisk describes the shooter. We go up to the loft above the Brisk and Sons shop to talk in private. 
                        Cage and Arnie go see Fibria at her shop. We try to play it cool but it doesn’t work. She tells us that cannons came from the refugee camp and they have been working on hand cannon protective armor for years. Something smells fishy.</p>

                    We are ambushed by multiple bandits on the way to their camp. Arnie uses Evard’s black tentacles and hits multiple bandits. 
                    During the fight, the Bandit Boss and Bandit Caster are revealed.
                    We take out as many as we can but the Caster and Boss slip away, back into the crack in the mountain. We hear loud, vibrating steps coming from the crack.</p>

We meet Zazur, human scientist working for the cultists and those above them running the show. He is the reason there are dinosaurs on the island. He has been here a long time. He tells us about the  Drow Elf named Drast. The guy in charge goes by Stong.
                        We are close. Fargrim has the puzzle box.

                        We head back to Zazur and he gives us all a spell. The Staff of Necromancy goes to Fargrim because he has those type of spells.
                        We continue to move through the tunnels and find some secret passageways. We find a mesh doorway that Sly uses Gaseous Form and goes through the mesh. He stands on a pedestal and opens the secret mesh passageway. We find more secret passageways and find ourselves at the end of the tunnels, with Stong holding Kanu by the neck, dangling over the ledge above the lava.

                        We enter another room. We find a happy ghost dog. Carved in the wall “who a good boy?” We all stand in the center of the room and Cage says the phrase in Giant, unlocking the exiting. 
                        We enter another room, with three separate rooms covered in specific items. As soon as we entered, an hour glass started. The biggest room has bread and water on the table. The second room is filled with food and snacks. The third room is filled with booze. This is our resting spot, for four hours.

                    <p>Randall Skaggs – pelt merchant – notices Sly and offers to sell him a raptor hide but can’t afford it. Randall then offers us work to capture a raptor and collect its hide. We accept.

                        We head to find the Raptor. It attacks Sly as he flies over him. 
                        A T-Rex comes out of the woodworks and eats half the Raptor, the other half of the Raptor drops down into the gully.</p>

                        We decide to fight the T-Rex. We are going to tie its feet by having Sly fly and wrap a rope around it.
                        Sly hooks the rope on the T- Rex’s feet and wraps him up.
                        Cage throws a Javeline and hits.
                        We defeat the T-Rex. We harvest its meat and hide and bring it back to the merchant back in town.

                        During the ceremony, the volcano erupts.
                        We all sprint for the harbor. 
                        Fargrim gets on the ship. Nic, Sly and myself go underground with the guild members.
